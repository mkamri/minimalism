            <p>As more and more people enjoy the life-changing benefits of simplicity, our simple-living online space has gotten cluttered with opinions and arguments about the “best” way to be a minimalist.</p>
            <p>I'm here to simplify all that information into a one-stop resource to help you launch your very own minimalist journey. I’ll also be linking some popular blogs, books and articles along the way for further reading.</p>

            <h3>why minimalism?</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read a self-help book, you’ve probably heard of the importance of why-power. Having a firm grasp on <em>why</em> you’re doing something is crucial to sticking with it when things get tough. </p>
            <p>Minimalism may be simple, but it isn’t easy at first. There will be moments when you question yourself, when you relapse, or when you want to give up entirely. In these difficult times, having a journal entry or a word document reminding you of your goals is paramount.</p>

            <div class="clean">
                <h4>My house is a mess.</h4>
                <p>I feel like I’m constantly cleaning, but nothing seems to stay clean for long. I feel anxious or exhausted when I come home and see the state of things. I hate doing huge loads of laundry. The dishes seem to be forever dirty. I lose things often. <strong>I want to enjoy my living space.</strong></p>

            <div class="finance">
                <h4>I keep buying things I don’t need.</h4>
                <p>I’m in debt, but for some reason I keep buying things I know I don’t need. I run out of money by the end of the month and don’t know where it goes. I keep finding excuses to go shopping and it’s affecting my relationships and my mental health. <strong>I want to heal my finances.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="distraction">
                <h4>I’m always distracted.</h4>
                <p>I feel like my brain is jumbled up. I have trouble focusing on one thing at a time. I have so much I need to do every day and I can’t seem to find time for my personal goals. I have so many projects that I don’t end up working on any of them. <strong>I want to become productive.</strong></p>
            </div>

    
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="step-one-3">
            <h3>take action</h3>
            <p>Write down what you are <strong>dissatisfied</strong> with in your current life. This can be anything, including things that seem unrelated to minimalism.</p>
            <p>Use this dissatisfaction list to determine what you <strong>wish</strong> your life looked like. This could be a dream schedule (I wish my day looked like…), a mood wishlist (I wish my life was relaxing, adventurous, productive, etc), or anything else you’d like more of in your life.</p>
            <p>Get creative! Write yourself a letter for when you get frustrated and want to give up. Draw a picture of your dream living room. Make a pinterest board of some minimalist spaces that inspire you. Do whatever you need to get yourself motivated to get started, and to keep you going through the hard days.</p>
