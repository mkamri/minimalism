            <p>As more and more people enjoy the life-changing benefits of simplicity, our simple-living online space has gotten cluttered with opinions and arguments about the “best” way to be a minimalist.</p>
            <p>I'm here to simplify all that information into a one-stop resource to help you launch your very own minimalist journey. I’ll also be linking some popular blogs, books and articles along the way for further reading.</p>

            <h3>why minimalism?</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read a self-help book, you’ve probably heard of the importance of why-power. Having a firm grasp on <em>why</em> you’re doing something is crucial to sticking with it when things get tough. </p>
            <p>Minimalism may be simple, but it isn’t easy at first. There will be moments when you question yourself, when you relapse, or when you want to give up entirely. In these difficult times, having a journal entry or a word document reminding you of your goals is paramount.</p>

            <div class="clean">
                <h4>My house is a mess.</h4>
                <p>I feel like I’m constantly cleaning, but nothing seems to stay clean for long. I feel anxious or exhausted when I come home and see the state of things. I hate doing huge loads of laundry. The dishes seem to be forever dirty. I lose things often. <strong>I want to enjoy my living space.</strong></p>

                <h4>I keep buying things I don’t need.</h4>
                <p>I’m in debt, but for some reason I keep buying things I know I don’t need. I run out of money by the end of the month and don’t know where it goes. I keep finding excuses to go shopping and it’s affecting my relationships and my mental health. <strong>I want to heal my finances.</strong></p>

                <h4>I’m always distracted.</h4>
                <p>I feel like my brain is jumbled up. I have trouble focusing on one thing at a time. I have so much I need to do every day and I can’t seem to find time for my personal goals. I have so many projects that I don’t end up working on any of them. <strong>I want to become productive.</strong></p>

            <h3>take action</h3>
            <p>Write down what you are <strong>dissatisfied</strong> with in your current life. This can be anything, including things that seem unrelated to minimalism.</p>
            <p>Use this dissatisfaction list to determine what you <strong>wish</strong> your life looked like. This could be a dream schedule (I wish my day looked like…), a mood wishlist (I wish my life was relaxing, adventurous, productive, etc), or anything else you’d like more of in your life.</p>
            <p>Get creative! Write yourself a letter for when you get frustrated and want to give up. Draw a picture of your dream living room. Make a pinterest board of some minimalist spaces that inspire you. Do whatever you need to get yourself motivated to get started, and to keep you going through the hard days.</p>

        <div class="step-two-1">
            <p>Alright, you’re ready to take the plunge. How exactly do you go about getting rid of your stuff?</p>
            <p>This initial “purge” is the most debated and complicated part of the minimalist journey. Should I keep this or give it away? What about if it was a gift? How about if it brings me joy? Knitting is my favorite hobby and I need at least fifty balls of yarn to even wake up in the morning, how about that?</p>
            <p><strong>"What if I need this someday?"</strong></p>
            <p>In the end, it’s up to you to decide what method to use to get rid of your stuff. You get to choose your guidelines on what stays and what goes. It’s your life, after all.</p>
            <p>However, if you want to see serious effects in your life, you have to make serious changes. No one ever sat around thinking about how they <em>should</em> do something and ended up with life-changing results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-two-2">
            <h3>what to do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep a thing that you use on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis.</li>
                <li>Keep a thing that brings you <em>a lot</em> of joy.</li>
                <li>Keep a thing that aligns with the lifestyle you defined in step one.</li>
                <li>Start by getting rid of obvious junk, then make your way up to sentimental items.</li>
                <li>Set a start date and an end date for your initial big purge. Stop waiting for it to be convenient. It will never be convenient to uproot your life and start fresh.</li>
                <li>Choose a method to get rid of your things, such as the <a href="https://konmari.com/" target="_blank">KonMari method</a>, the <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/game/" target="_blank">Minimalist game</a> , the <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/">Packing Party</a>, or another method that you’ve defined.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step-two-3">
            <h3>what not to do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep a thing <strong>only</strong> because it was a <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/gifts/" target="_blank">gift</a>. The gift giver will probably never notice that it’s gone, anyway. </li>
                <li>Keep a thing <strong>only</strong> because it was <a href="http://thebeautyinsimple.com/getting-rid-of-expensive-things/" target="_blank">expensive</a>. The biggest waste is using your space on something you don’t want anymore.</li>
                <li>Keep a thing "<a href="http://www.newminimalism.com/blog/jic" target="_blank">just in case</a>". Unless you know exactly when you will use the item next, you are wasting time and space on <em>a future you who may never exist.</em> Just get rid of it. I promise you will only end up re-purchasing a small fraction of what you’ve given away, and the re-buy will be money well spent.</li>
